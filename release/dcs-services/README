This project is an aggregator POM for releasing the various DCS services
projects.

Although all projects are contained within the same svn source 
repository, they have separate branches, tags, and trunks.  This complicates
release via the release plugin.   The solution is to use the exec maven
plugin to invoke the release plugin separately on each project.  For example:

mvn exec:exec -Paggregate_release -Dexec.executable=mvn -Dexec.args="release:prepare deploy release:perform -Dgoals=deploy -Dtag=1.1.0 -DreleaseVersion=1.1.0 -DdevelopmentVersion=1.2.0-SNAPSHOT"

This will cause an appropriate tags directory to be created, and the release
and snapshot artifacts deployed to the appropriate repositories.  Sites can
be deployed in a separate step.
